# Murky-CHARM
This is the official Github repo of Murky-CHARM: Coral Health Assessment framework using Robots in Murky environments. We provide the implementation of our proposed guidance system, sampling for mapping algorithm (Maplion), our collected murky coral segmentation dataset, a pretrained segmentation model on our murky coral segementation data and an implementation of our web interface to store all the relevant field data for consistent mapping and analysis.

### Murky Coral Segmentation Dataset and Finetuned Murky Coral Segmentation Model
Please refer to the MarvlCoralScapes repository for more details. We provide the scripts we used for finetuning and visualization.

Here are the links to download the dataset and weights for the model:
